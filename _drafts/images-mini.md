# Image minimization

There are various tools for image optimization that you can integrate into your workflow.

One of my favorites is [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com), which can also minimize JPG files.
The savings are quite high and usually there is barely a visible difference between the original and the compressed file.

You can use TinyPNG via direct upload on the website, but there are also Photoshop, Wordpress and Grunt Plugins.
